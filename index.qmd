Hi, my name is Neil Shephard and I'm a Research Software Engineer at the University of Sheffield. I've had a
varied career path to this point working in statistical genetics, medical statistics and a few years in a tech startup
company before returning to my current role in academia.

Throughout my career I've had a passion for open and reproducible research and Free Open Source Software, teaching
myself and advocating for literate programming and version control of code and was delighted to find this aligned well
with the goals and aims of Research Software Engineering.

Since becoming an RSE I have undertaken a number of initiatives that advocate and encourage good practice in both coding
and more broadly for open research.

I've set up the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield and successfully relaunched the Sheffield R User
Group which meets roughly once a month to discuss and share work using the R programming language. I've also got the
local ReproducibiliTea Journal Club back up and running in Sheffield, which also meets monthly to discuss aspects of open
research.

I think its important to share what I've learnt and therefore blog regularly on technical issues and this has led me to
giving talks at University of Leeds and RSE Midlands.

::: {.notes}
On a day-to-day basis as an RSE I work on helping research teams develop maintainable and open software that strives to
adhere to the FAIR for Research Software principle and my main project, TopoStats which is software for processing
Atomic Force Microscopy images won the Universities Open Research Prize in 2023.

I've undertaken The Carpentries Instructor Training and regularly deliver training on the basics of using Git to version
control software and have delivered the Carpentries course on [The UNIX Shell][unix]

I really like the paedological style of The Carpentries and have developed an intermediary course on Git to follow on
and give users a deeper understanding of Git.

With this in mind I spend a lot of time writing code and appreciate how important it is to have an effective development
environment. I would like to take the opportunity that the SSI Fellowship affords to share my experience of development
environments with others and support people in learning how to craft something that suits their needs.

## Fellowship Overview

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

- Tools/tooling >> productivity.
- Emacs as an IDE (Free Open Source Software).
- Develop basic literate configuration.
- Develop and deliver Carpentries style course.

::: {.notes}
Tools and/or tooling for software development are important, when well configured and they are  easy to use IDEs can
save developers considerable time in navigating, writing and refactoring code. Over the years IDEs have come and gone,
some are proprietary others open source, many use a freemium model, some cease to be developed. [Lindy's Law](lindyslaw)
proposes that the life expectancy of technology is proportional to its current age. To which end choosing a well
established Free and Open Source Software IDE would be a good choice for investing time and effort in learning
to use.

As we encourage research software to be free and open I believe the same should hold true of the tools we
use as it gives us greater flexibility to develop and customise them to our own preferences and share our work back with
the community that developed them.

To this end I have used Emacs for around twenty years and it's incredibly flexible and extensible for
writing and development. As part of the fellowship I plan to develop a basic literate configuration, for using Emacs as
an IDE.

This would form the basis for a Carpentries style course on how to use Emacs as an IDE for
code development, covering the use of various key packages within Emacs that make for an efficient workflow.
:::

<!-- ## Literate Configuration -->

<!-- Derive a [literate configuration][literateconfig] -->

<!-- - Language Server Protocol mode for Python, R, Markdown. -->
<!-- - [Magit][magit] for Git. -->
<!-- - [Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS)][ess] for R/Stata/SAS -->
<!-- - Basic Org-mode configuration. -->

<!-- ::: {.notes} -->
<!-- The literate configuration would cover several areas. -->

<!-- Firstly, setting up and configuring Emacs to work with Language Server Protocol for common languages. These are the -->
<!-- programmes that are separate to and sit behind the smart features of code navigation and editing. Configuring this for -->
<!-- Python, R and Markdown will provide a starting point for users. -->

<!-- As software development requires version control being able to perform all tasks directly from your IDE reduces -->
<!-- friction. Emacs has a very well developed Git client called [Magit][magit] which makes it very easy to perform all -->
<!-- tasks. -->

<!-- In addition to Language Server Protocol the [Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS)][ess] would be covered as it provides an -->
<!-- excellent interface to work with statistical software such as R. -->

<!-- Finally the basics of using Emacs' native literate language Org mode would be covered. -->

## Capable Research Communities

:::: {.columns}

- [M-x Research][mxresearch]

### Activities

- Hackathon to revise and complete configuration and training material.
- Deliver material locally and nationally both in-person and on-line.

::: {.notes}
Over the years I've learnt through my involvement with different communities, and more recently my involvement in local
community building in Sheffield and developing and delivering training material that they are key to guiding the
development of inclusive and effective materials.

In the UK there is already an active academic Emacs community `M-x Research`. The community meets every fortnight to
discuss aspects of Emacs usage and I aim to engage with this community to guide development of the training material
seeking regular feedback on content, style and presentation.

Whilst much development of training material and software can occur asynchronously and remotely there is huge benefit to
meeting others in person and developing material in focused times, to which end I would look to use a proportion of the
fellowship to organise a hackathon within the first six months of the fellowship to revise the material that has been
developed by that point.

Similarly whilst training material can be delivered online as well as in-person my experience over the last few years
has been that in-person is far more effective as you get better engagement and its easier to pick up when people are
struggling with concepts or tasks. To which end the remaining funding would be used to deliver the training material
both locally and nationally two to three times between 12-18 months out from receiving the fellowship.

## Dissemination

- Publish to Carpentries Incubator
- Blog about the process and invite feedback.
- Present at EmacsConf 2025
- Propose to deliver at RSECon25

::: {.notes}
To help further grow and nurture the community around training for Emacs I would look to publish the training material
to the [Carpentries Incubator][incubator] programme where wider contributions could then be made.

I would look to make regular blog posts as development progresses and invite feedback.

To increase awareness of the resulting material I would also aim to present at both the annual EmacsConf, and the RSE
Society's annual Conference.

## Summary

- Passionate about FOSS software development and RSE good practices.
- Experience developing and delivering teaching material.
- Experience with community engagement and development.
- Advocate for RSE good practices.
- Keen to share the knowledge and experience in collaboration with the Emacs community.

::: {.notes}
I'm a keen advocate for FOSS software development and usage and believe that FOSS software offers developers the
greatest freedom and development experience.

I have experience in both creating and delivering practical teaching material as well as experience in community
engagement and development from my activities over the last few years with the open research and R communities in
Sheffield.

I'm keen to share my knowledge and experience and in collaboration with the Emacs community develop and deliver valuable
teaching material which help lessen the learning curve to using Emacs for software development.
