I’ve had a varied career path to this point working in statistical genetics, medical statistics and a few years in a tech startup company before returning to my current role in academia.\nThroughout my career I’ve had a passion for open and reproducible research and Free Open Source Software, teaching myself and advocating for literate programming and version control of code and was delighted to find this aligned well with the goals and aims of Research Software Engineering.\nSince becoming an RSE I have undertaken a number of initiatives that advocate and encourage good practice in both coding and more broadly for open research.\nI’ve set up the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield and successfully relaunched the Sheffield R User Group which meets roughly once a month to discuss and share work using the R programming language. I’ve also got the local ReproducibiliTea Journal Club back up and running in Sheffield, which also meets monthly to discuss aspects of open research.\nI think its important to share what I’ve learnt and therefore blog regularly on technical issues and this has led me to giving talks at University of Leeds and RSE Midlands."

I would like to take the opportunity that the SSI Fellowship affords to share my experience of development environments with others and support people in learning how to craft something that suits their needs."

Over the years IDEs have come and gone, some are proprietary others open source, many use a freemium model, some cease to be developed. Lindy’s Law proposes that the life expectancy of technology is proportional to its current age. To which end choosing a well established Free and Open Source Software IDE would be a good choice for investing time and effort in learning to use.\nAs we encourage research software to be free and open I believe the same should hold true of the tools we use as it gives us greater flexibility to develop and customise them to our own preferences and share our work back with the community that developed them.\nTo this end I have used Emacs for around twenty years and it’s incredibly flexible and extensible for writing and development. As part of the fellowship I plan to develop a basic literate configuration, for using Emacs as an IDE.\nThis would form the basis for a Carpentries style course on how to use Emacs as an IDE for code development, covering the use of various key packages within Emacs that make for an efficient workflow."

The community meets every fortnight to discuss aspects of Emacs usage and I aim to engage with this community to guide development of the training material seeking regular feedback on content, style and presentation.\nWhilst much development of training material and software can occur asynchronously and remotely there is huge benefit to meeting others in person and developing material in focused times, to which end I would look to use a proportion of the fellowship to organise a hackathon within the first six months of the fellowship to revise the material that has been developed by that point.\nSimilarly whilst training material can be delivered online as well as in-person my experience over the last few years has been that in-person is far more effective as you get better engagement and its easier to pick up when people are struggling with concepts or tasks. To which end the remaining funding would be used to deliver the training material both locally and nationally two to three times between 12-18 months out from receiving the fellowship."
